The program  
- Calculates the parameters θ of the regression curve using the method of gradient descent.
- Has manually chosen appropriate values for eps and α to achieve a good balance between the quality and speed of the algorithm.
- Presents the dependencies between the cost and various values of eps or α on a graph.
- Using the obtained regression curve, predicts the number of burglaries per thousand residents for a district where there are on average 50, 100, 200 fires per thousand households.
